            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm Eli Giglietti. I was born in New York but grew up in Brookline, MA. 
                I went to Brookline Hight School where I was on the highschool soccer team. 
                I am currently a Senior at Colby College majoring in Economics with a concentration in Financial Markets and a minor in Computer Science. 
                In my free time, I enjoy playing sports such as soccer and tennis, as well as strategy games like Chess and Settlers of Catan.</p>
